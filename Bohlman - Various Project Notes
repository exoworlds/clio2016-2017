9/19/2016 - Vaccuums and dewar flasks
To test the dewar flask, after screwing everything in and made sure all of the O-Rings were aligned, a vaccuum ran in order to purge the flask
of air. The flask was initially at 760 Tor, and with the end result, we wanted the particles in the dewar flask to have a mean free path of 
about a tenth of a meter. This will ensure that when the flask is cooled, there will be no collisions between particles that conduct heat.
In order to purge all of the air from the flask, a lower pump is ran in order to lower the pressure down to 1 millitorr.
Then, a faster vaccuum is ran in order to take the flash the rest of the way. The second fan moves at about 5,000- 55,000 rpm.
We hope it works.
