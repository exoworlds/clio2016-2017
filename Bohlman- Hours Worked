Date              Hours Worked      Worked On
9/15/2016         2                 Introduction to AO, overview of the future projects, specifics for the project in terms of software
9/16/2016         2                 Installed, Notepad++, Git, Anaconda, pip. All seem to be function (No idea how to use most of them...). Photulis install failed (building wheel failed). Awaiting further instruction for troubleshooting + instruction
9/17/2016         4                 Troubleshooted with Ubuntu computer for use with dewar, Practiced Python on Codecademy (syntax, strings/console output, conditionals/control flow, functions)
9/19/2016         2                 Worked on dewar Ubuntu computer configuration, but couldn't connect to Internet. Assembled the dewar flask and started running the vaccuum in order to purge it of air.
9/20/2016         3                 Completed Functions and Lists/Dictionaries in Codeacademy's Python course. Finished GitHub intoductory tutorial
9/21/2016         2.25              Opened dewar, tried to instil astropy, ds9 and other necessary python programs, but couldn't. Starting thread on pyds9 to discuss error. Put temperature sensor inside of dewar and proceeded to reseal it in order to vaccuum it again. Awaiting further instructions.
9/23/2016         4.25              tried to install astropy (no avail), learned how to work with fits images in python, started project of graphing integration time of fits images versus count, finished with plot of ints vs counts
9/27/2016         3.5               worked with phil and cooled the dewar with liquid nitrogen, project notes are on githubs
9/28/2016         1                 worked with Phil on clio computer, got all of the drivers unzipped and installed, but phil has to work with them to make sure they're installed correctly. Computer project is now at standstill for me. Opened up dewar again to installnew equipment, but that will happen later.
9/29/2016         2.25              worked with python in analyzing fits images, uploaded the best line fit (up to 2000 ints) and the plot of ints vs counts, attempted to work on true counts vs. measured counts, very nearly there.
10/03/2016        2                 worked with python in analyzing the error of the counts of each of the fits images, by using the desired linear relationship, a quadratic relationship, a cubic relationship, and a quartic relationship.
10/05/2016        2                 worked with python in actually finishing the correct true counts vs. measured counts plots, cleaned up code, and made seperate plots of true vs measured c, a linear fit to good data of that, a quadratic fit to good data of that, a cubic fit to good data of that, and a quartic fit to good data of that
10/06/2016        3.25              worked with python in seeing which polynomial matched up with the linear fit the best for a bit, but then started working with the dewar. Opened the new detector and tried to install it, however, some problems were incurred. The detector was eventually sucsessfully installed, a temp. sensor was attached to it, and the dewar was closed and the vacuum pump started pumping.
10/07/2016        3.5 (3 on TS)     dewar dewar DEWAR
10/10/2016        4.5               cooling the dewar: an execise in patience and lack of liquid nitrogen


*Claimed hours on timesheet


To do:
SET UP DIFFERENT MODULES IN DIFFERENT FILES
Jagged lines on plot: what do we do to mitagte that and fix best line curve?
write report in style of scientific journal
