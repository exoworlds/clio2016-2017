31                    Maximum liquid nitro was approaching, so I was able to start directly filling dewar outer up
                      After about 4 funnel fulls, the dewar was close to being filled since the liquid nitorgen was boiling out of the top

At this point, I filled it up with the equivalent of 2 funnels, and the dewar was filled again on the outside.

The funnel having a leak may have thrown off the last couple of measurements. i.e. more was pured in than what made it in the dewar.
