1. Read in the cubed files
2. apply linearity correction to all images them while I read them in: apply to every single pixel in the pictur (within a new function in a loop)
3. Subtract images from each other
group 1:   1    2   3
group 2:   4    5   6
So 1-4, 2-5, 3-6 and so on and so forth
4. Write a fits file to disk, save to computer, open ds9 to look at them, and depending on how far I get, we will either get the peak pixel (which is kind of a shortcut) or we do a different phptometry method to determine how bright the star is.
